#QUOIN CODING EXERCISE

Alex Moser - January 2015

This is split up into 3 sprints accordingly considering a few uknowns, applied front a front end perspective. I tried to order by importance, making sprint 1 the most important items/foundational things with the clause being this can ofcourse change based off clients needs.

Uknowns :
	Unsure if there are deliverables for each sprint, of if project is to be complete and handed in by end of sprint 3
	Edge cases for multiple discounts


Sprint 1 -

	Set up basic templates and hooks for allowing user to buy and Use pass.

	Set up all general hooks for functions.

	Determine object for user considering info provided on SRS

	Set up basic javascript testing

		My goal with sprtint 1 is to set a good foundation to build off of moving forward


Sprint 2 -

	Verification on form

	Purchasing logic

	Send (purchase) new pass

	Recieve and verify of monthly pass (user swipes card and object comes in to use)

	Flush out UI


Sprint 3 -

	Check Balance

	Verify montlhy pass type on use 

	Edge case scenarios

	Add Verifications for Age/student/worker discounts

	Create Discount filter

  My Time was spent :

  About 2 hours - writing sprint 1 functions, considering use cases and determing the idea of core build
  About 4 hours  - scaffolding out the project and setting test harneses, setting a basic framework
  

  A few exta things completed after this allocated time - discount filter ( I had a quick idea for it and wanted to see if I could write a simple test for it too)
